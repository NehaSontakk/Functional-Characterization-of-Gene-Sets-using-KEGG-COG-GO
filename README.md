# Functional-Characterization-of-Gene-Sets-using-KEGG-COG-GO


1. Create excel files with your gene sets of interest, in this case I have named it Gene_Set_of_interest.xlsx (you can upload multiple files with different names and gene sets). Please submit CCNA numbers only, not real names of the genes.
2. Download Github repository files
    1. CCNA_CAUVN_taxid565050_Uniprot_GOA_240323.xlsx
    2. KEGG_CCNA_All.xlsx
    3. COG_CCNA_All.xlsx
    4. KEGG_pathway_masterfile.xlsx
    5. gene_cog_table_duplicates_removed.xlsx
3. Open the .ipynb file on google collab on your drive.
4. Functional Annotation and Enrichment calculations on dataset of interest using KEGG, COG, GO.ipynb
5. Upload the files from github repository to the google collab file
6. Run the first line of code
7. Add the files for your gene set of interest in the folder called data
8. Run all the code cells after data has been uploaded.
